### Q7: Calculate the average overall magnitude of peak acceleration using the 99th percentiles of the X, Y, and Z axes.

#### AUTOIOT_PAPER

**Answer:** To calculate the average overall magnitude of peak acceleration using the 99th percentiles of the X, Y, and Z axes, we need to ensure that the numpy library is properly imported and used. 

The error message "name 'np' is not defined" indicates that the numpy library is not imported correctly. However, in the provided code, the numpy library is imported as `import numpy as np`. 

The issue might be due to the fact that the `np` alias is not used correctly in the calculation of magnitudes. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def calculate_average_magnitude(df):
    """
    Calculate the average overall magnitude of peak acceleration using the 99th percentiles of the X, Y, and Z axes.

    Args:

        float: Average overall magnitude of peak acceleration.
    """

    # Check if the input DataFrame is not empty
    if df.empty:
        raise ValueError("Input DataFrame is empty")

    # Extract the 99th percentiles of the X, Y, and Z axes
    x_p99 = df['accel_stats_x_p99']
    y_p99 = df['accel_stats_y_p99']

### Q10: Did rainy weather cause the roughest segments in this route?

#### AUTOIOT_PAPER

**Answer:** No, the execution output indicates that it was "Unable to determine if rainy weather caused the roughest segments due to missing 'weather' data."

- Executed: True | Rejected: False | Judge: N/A
- Stages: autoiot_terms,autoiot_search_queries,autoiot_retrieval,autoiot_design_high,autoiot_design_detail,autoiot_module_gen,autoiot_code_integration,autoiot_agent_loop,autoiot_select
- Latency: 731.49s | Cost: $0.03495

### Q11: Which bus driver generated the smoothest driving profile?

#### AUTOIOT_PAPER

**Answer:** The bus driver who generated the smoothest driving profile cannot be determined due to the absence of the required dataset (`telematics_data.csv`).

        # Assign the result to the variable
        result = smoothest_driver['driver_id']
Observation: Error: The file 'telematics_data.csv' does not exist.
Final Answer: The bus driver who generated the smoothest driving profile cannot be determined due to the absence of the required dataset (`telematics_data.csv`).

## Baseline Comparison Notes

- **LLM-Only**: no schema grounding, no execution — may hallucinate.
- **WellMax-Only**: S1+S2+S3 grounding, then direct grounded execution (no guardrail, no judge).
- **Agent-Only**: raw-query pandas execution only (no guardrail, no codebook grounding).
- **Flash-Fusion**: full grounding pipeline + guardrail + pre-agent plan judge (+ one refinement) + grounded execution.
